Session Prompt: Removal of LLM Chat Components in MCP Test UI

**Objective:**
The primary goal was to refactor the LLM chat functionality currently residing in `mcp_test_ui/app.py` into more modular components. However, the decision has been made to **completely remove** all LLM chat-related functionality from the `mcp_test_ui` application.

**Reason for Removal:**
- Simplify the `mcp_test_ui` application.
- Focus the application solely on testing MCP tool discovery and execution via the `/mcp/` routes.
- Reduce complexity and maintenance overhead associated with LLM provider integrations and chat features.

**Outcome:**
- All chat-related Python code (routes, handlers, LLM provider integrations, utility functions) has been removed from `mcp_test_ui/app.py`.
- Chat-specific Pydantic models (`Message`, `ChatRequest`, `ToolCall`, `ToolResult`) have been removed from `mcp_test_ui/models.py`.
- The `mcp_test_ui/templates/chat.html` template has been deleted.
- The application now exclusively serves the MCP tool testing interface available under the `/mcp/` path.

This document is now for historical reference regarding the previous refactoring plan, which has been superseded by the removal of the feature.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Test with an invalid/missing API key for a selected provider.
    *   Test chat functionality when the MCP server path (for tool calls) is invalid or the server is not running.
    *   Verify that user-friendly error messages are displayed in the UI or appropriate error responses (e.g., 400, 500) are returned by the API.
*   **Log Verification:** Throughout testing, monitor browser console logs and server-side logs (`mcp_test_ui` FastAPI app logs and `fastmcp_server.log`) for any errors or unexpected behavior.

**Key Learnings & "Gotchas" from Previous Refactoring (for the AI Agent):**

*   **Python Executable Path:** When running Python scripts directly or as subprocesses (like `PythonStdioTransport` does), always use the absolute path to the Python executable within the project's virtual environment (e.g., `/Users/petetreadaway/Projects/ebay-mcp-server/.venv/bin/python`). Relying on `python` in the system PATH can lead to `command not found` errors or using the wrong interpreter.
*   **FastAPI Router Prefixes & Client-Side URLs:** If a FastAPI router is included with a `prefix` (e.g., `app.include_router(my_router, prefix="/module")`), all routes within `my_router` will be prepended with `/module`. Ensure any client-side JavaScript making AJAX calls uses the complete, correct URL (e.g., `/module/actual_route`).
*   **Pydantic v2+ Aliases:** For Pydantic models using field aliases (e.g., `field_name: str = Field(alias="json_alias")`), ensure that when instantiating the model, you use the alias as the keyword argument (e.g., `MyModel(json_alias="value")`) to avoid validation errors. This was critical for `MCPToolParameter`.
*   **`fastmcp.Client` Configuration:** The `fastmcp.Client` requires a `transport` argument. For running a local Python MCP server script, `PythonStdioTransport` is used, which itself needs `script_path` (path to `src/server.py`) and `python_cmd` (path to the venv Python executable).
*   **Playwright and Dynamic Content:** For UIs where content loads or appears dynamically (e.g., after an API call), use Playwright's `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.evaluate()` with custom JavaScript polling logic to ensure elements are present and visible before attempting to interact with them or retrieve their content. This prevents race conditions and flakiness in tests.
*   **Server Restarts:** After making changes to backend Python code (FastAPI app, routers, utilities), the UI server must be restarted for changes to take effect. Use a command like `lsof -ti:<port> | xargs kill -9 2>/dev/null || true` before the start command to ensure the port is free. The FastMCP server (`src/server.py`) also needs restarting (`./start.sh restart`) if its code changes.
*   **`.env` File Parsing:** The `python-dotenv` library can be sensitive to the formatting of `.env` files. Ensure comments start at the beginning of a line and values are appropriately quoted if they contain special characters or spaces to avoid parsing warnings.
*   **Modular Imports & `sys.path`:** When moving code into subdirectories/modules, ensure Python's import system can find them. Prefer relative imports (e.g., `from .my_module import MyClass`) within a package. Avoid excessive `sys.path.append()` if possible.
*   **Configuration (`config.py`):** A centralized `config.py` for shared application settings (like `mcp_server_path`, API keys loaded from env, cached data) proved effective and should be utilized for chat-related configurations as well.
*   **Dependency Injection (e.g., Templates):** The pattern of using an initialization function (e.g., `init_router_dependencies(templates_obj)`) to pass shared objects like `Jinja2Templates` instances to routers is a clean way to manage dependencies.
*   **`CHANGELOG.md`:** Maintain the practice of prepending detailed, timestamped entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for each significant refactoring step, feature, or fix.
*   **README.md:** Finally Update the README to reflect the new structure and any changes in the refactoring process.
