## Updates in Trajectory Linting update_offer_safe.py, (10062025 - 11:53:39)

### Code Quality

- **`src/ebay_mcp/inventory/update_offer_safe.py` Linting**: Applied various linting fixes to improve code style and readability. Changes include adding type hints, ensuring appropriate line lengths, and standardizing formatting for better maintainability.

## Updates in Trajectory Fix update_offer_safe Validation and Enhance Offer Tools, (10062025 - 11:46:00)

### Bug Fix & Enhancements

- **`update_offer_safe.py` Fix**: Resolved a Pydantic validation issue with the `update_offer_safe` tool. The function signature's type hints were updated to use `Optional` (e.g., `Optional[str]`) for all parameters that default to `None`. This ensures that the MCP Inspector correctly generates an input schema allowing users to omit optional fields, relying on the tool's internal logic to fetch and preserve existing offer data. Previously, not providing all fields led to validation errors before the tool's logic could execute.

## Updates in Trajectory Add Publish Offer, Clarify Get Offer, and External Tool Info, (10062025 - 11:38:08)

### New Feature & Enhancements

- **`get_offer.py` Enhancement**: Updated the docstring of the `get_offer` tool to explicitly state "Get Offer by OfferID" for clarity and to differentiate it from SKU-based lookups.
- **New `publish_offer.py` Tool**: Added a new MCP tool `publish_offer` that allows an agent to publish a specific offer using its `offer_id`. This converts an unpublished offer into an active eBay listing. The tool was created based on the official eBay Sell Inventory API documentation for the `publishOffer` endpoint.
  - Registered the new tool in `src/ebay_mcp/inventory/server.py`.

### Tool Management Clarification

- **External Tools (`tests_add`, `DB mockup`)**: Investigated the request to remove `tests_add` (`mcp1_tests_add`) and `DB mockup` (`mcp1_database_mock_db_query`) tools. These tools are provided by the external `ebay-api` MCP server and are not part of this project's codebase. Therefore, they cannot be removed by modifying project files. Their removal would require changes to the `ebay-api` MCP server itself.

## Updates in Trajectory Refactor Offer Tools for Agent Control, (10062025 - 11:03:06)

### Refactor: Separated Offer Update Tools for Granular AI Agent Control

- **`update_offer` -> `update_offer_safe`**: Renamed the existing safe update tool to `update_offer_safe.py`. This tool continues to provide a safe "get-then-update" mechanism to prevent accidental data loss.
- **New `update_offer` (Unsafe)**: Created a new, unsafe `update_offer.py` tool that directly performs a `PUT` (replace) operation on the eBay API. This provides direct, low-level control for an AI agent that can manage the update payload itself. The docstring contains a critical warning about its use.
- **New `get_offer`**: Created a new `get_offer.py` tool to allow an agent to retrieve the full details of an existing offer. This is the first step in the recommended workflow for using the unsafe `update_offer` tool.
- **Server Registration**: Updated `src/ebay_mcp/inventory/server.py` to register the new `get_offer`, `update_offer`, and `update_offer_safe` tools.

This refactoring gives an advanced AI agent the flexibility to choose between a safe, abstracted update method or a direct, low-level one, enabling more sophisticated and efficient interactions with the eBay API.

## Updates in App MCP Server Comprehensive Route Mapping Fix (07062025 - 10:10:00)

### 🔧 MAJOR FIX: Complete Overhaul of Route Mapping for FastAPI Integration

**Implemented a comprehensive route mapping system to correctly expose FastAPI endpoints as MCP tools and resources.**

#### Issues Resolved:

1. **Missing `/api/products` Endpoints** 🔍 -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: Path parameter endpoints like `/api/products/{product_id}` weren't being recognized
   - **Root Cause**: Regular expressions in route patterns didn't correctly match paths
   - **Solution**: Implemented a prioritized route mapping system with specific patterns

2. **Endpoint Type Prioritization** ⚙️:
   - **New System**: Created explicit priority ordering for endpoint-to-component mapping
   - **Priority Order**: Exclusions > Forced Tools > /api/products > HTTP Method Rules > GET Params
   - **Result**: Correct and predictable mapping of endpoints to tool types

3. **Enhanced Debugging** 🛠️:
   - Added OpenAPI spec JSON export for detailed inspection
   - Created path parameter analysis with detailed logging
   - Added dedicated files for tools and resources (mcp_tools.txt, mcp_resources.txt)
   - Improved error handling for async FastMCP API calls

4. **Structured Route Configuration** 📊:
   - Implemented `ROUTE_MAPPING` dictionary for clear HTTP method mapping
   - Defined explicit rules for handling each HTTP method:
     - `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH` → Tools
     - `GET` without parameters → Resources
     - `GET` with path parameters → Resource Templates

#### Technical Implementation:

```python
# Prioritized route mapping system
route_maps = [
    # 1. Exclusions (highest priority)
    RouteMap(methods=["POST", "GET", "PUT", "DELETE", "PATCH"], pattern=f"^{endpoint}$", route_type=RouteType.IGNORE),
    
    # 2. Forced tools (high priority)
    RouteMap(methods=["GET"], pattern=f"^{endpoint}$", route_type=RouteType.TOOL),
    
    # 3. Product endpoints with path parameters (specific priority)
    RouteMap(methods=["GET"], pattern=r"^/api/products/[^/]+$", route_type=RouteType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE),
    
    # 4-6. Method-based rules (low priority)
    # POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE -> Tools
    # GET with params -> Resource Templates
    # GET without params -> Resources
]
```

This comprehensive overhaul ensures that all FastAPI endpoints from api.petetreadaway.com are correctly exposed as MCP tools and resources, making them accessible through the MCP protocol.

## Updates in App MCP Server Async Method Fix (07062025 - 10:05:56)

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Fixed Async Method Handling in App MCP Server

**Fixed warning messages about coroutines not being awaited in App MCP Server.**

#### Issues Resolved:

1. **Async Method Calls** ⚠️ -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: `get_tools()` and `get_resources()` methods were called without `await`
   - **Warning Messages**: `RuntimeWarning: coroutine 'FastMCP.get_tools' was never awaited`
   - **Solution**: Added `await` keyword to async method calls

2. **Resource and Tool Type Handling** 🔄:
   - **Problem**: Inconsistent handling of resource types (string vs object with uri attribute)
   - **Solution**: Implemented more robust type checking with `isinstance()` and `hasattr()`
   - **Result**: Properly handles both string-based resources and object-based resources

#### Technical Changes:

```python
# Before: Non-awaited async calls
tools = self.mcp.get_tools()
resources = self.mcp.get_resources()

# After: Properly awaited async calls
tools = await self.mcp.get_tools()
resources = await self.mcp.get_resources()
```

#### Benefits:

- Eliminates runtime warnings about coroutines
- Properly displays debug information about exposed tools and resources
- More robust handling of different resource representation formats
- Better compatibility with FastMCP's latest API conventions

This fix ensures proper async/await handling in the App MCP Server, making debug output accurate and eliminating runtime warnings.

## Updates in App MCP Server Route Mapping Fix (07062025 - 09:57:44)

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Resolved Missing /api/products Endpoints

**Fixed issues with the App MCP Server where endpoints from api.petetreadaway.com were not showing up correctly.**

#### Issues Resolved:

1. **Missing `/api/products` Endpoints** ❌ -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: The `/api/products` endpoints were not visible in MCP tools
   - **Root Cause**: Incorrect route mapping patterns targeting `/products` instead of `/api/products`
   - **Solution**: Added proper route mapping for `/api/products` endpoints

2. **Path Parameter Handling** ❌ -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: Endpoints with path parameters like `/api/products/{product_id}` weren't properly exposed
   - **Solution**: Added specific route pattern for `/api/products/{...}` endpoints as resource templates
   - **Result**: Endpoints with path parameters now properly accessible as resource templates

3. **Enhanced Debugging** ⚙️:
   - Added `ROUTE_MAPPING_DEBUG` environment variable for detailed logging of route mapping
   - When enabled, logs all paths from OpenAPI spec and created MCP components
   - Helps identify which endpoints are mapped to tools vs resources

4. **Consistent Server Structure** 🏗️:
   - Added `run()` function to match pattern from `main_server.py`
   - Ensures both servers can be used interchangeably

#### Technical Implementation:

- Added `FORCE_AS_TOOLS` list to explicitly define endpoints that should be exposed as tools:
  ```python
  FORCE_AS_TOOLS = [
      '/api/products',
      '/api/categories'
  ]
  ```

- Added targeted route mapping for products with path parameters:
  ```python
  RouteMap(
      methods=["GET"],
      pattern=r"^/api/products/\{.*?\}",  # Target specific products endpoints with parameters
      route_type=RouteType.RESOURCE_TEMPLATE
  )
  ```

- Added comprehensive component logging when debug is enabled to verify all created tools and resources

The App MCP Server now correctly exposes all endpoints from api.petetreadaway.com, with proper handling for path parameters.

## Updates in App MCP Server Naming Compliance Fix (06062025 - 09:05:00)

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Resolved MCP Naming Violations and Missing Endpoints

**Fixed both major issues with the App MCP Server tool generation.**

#### Issues Resolved:

1. **MCP Naming Violations** ❌ -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: Auto-generated tool names contained double underscores (`__`) which violate MCP naming rules `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`
   - **Examples**: `get_category_suggestions_api_products__product_id__category_suggestions_post`
   - **Solution**: Implemented `_fix_operation_ids()` method to clean OpenAPI operation IDs before FastMCP processing
   - **Result**: All 13 tools now have MCP-compliant names

2. **Missing Endpoints** ❌ -> ✅:
   - **Problem**: GET endpoints with path parameters like `/api/products/{product_id}` weren't visible in MCP tools
   - **Root Cause**: These endpoints correctly become **Resource Templates** (not tools) in MCP
   - **Solution**: Added explicit route mapping to ensure GET endpoints with path params become resource templates
   - **Result**: `/api/products/{product_id}` now available as `get_product_by_id_api_products_product_id_get/{product_id}`

#### Technical Implementation:

**Name Cleaning Algorithm**:
```python
def _make_mcp_compliant_name(self, operation_id: str, path: str, method: str) -> str:
    # Replace multiple underscores with single underscore
    name = re.sub(r'_{2,}', '_', operation_id)
    # Remove invalid characters (keep only alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen)
    name = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9_-]', '', name)
    # Ensure 1-64 character length and proper start/end
    return name[:64].strip('_-')
```

**OpenAPI Spec Modification**:
- Modifies operation IDs directly in the OpenAPI specification before passing to FastMCP
- Ensures all generated MCP component names are compliant from the start
- Preserves original functionality while fixing naming issues

#### Results:

**Before Fix**:
- ❌ 4 tools with invalid names (double underscores)
- ❌ Missing `/api/products/{product_id}` endpoint
- ❌ MCP naming rule violations

**After Fix**:
- ✅ All 13 tools have MCP-compliant names
- ✅ 1 resource template for GET endpoints with path parameters
- ✅ 3 resources for GET endpoints without path parameters
- ✅ Full MCP naming compliance: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$`

#### Sample Fixed Names:
- `get_category_suggestions_api_products__product_id__category_suggestions_post`
  -> `get_category_suggestions_api_products_product_id_category_sugges`
- `publish_product_to_ebay_api_products__product_id__publish_to_ebay_post`
  -> `publish_product_to_ebay_api_products_product_id_publish_to_ebay`

The App MCP Server now generates fully compliant MCP tools and properly exposes all API endpoints according to MCP conventions.

## Updates in App MCP Server Implementation - Fixed (06062025 - 08:45:00)

### 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Resolved "Already running asyncio in this thread" Error

**Fixed the App MCP Server to work exactly like the eBay MCP Server pattern.**

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **"Already running asyncio in this thread" Error**:
   - Server was incorrectly trying to run as a standalone application
   - MCP servers are **client-started**, not standalone applications
   - Fixed by following the exact same pattern as `src/main_server.py`

2. **Initialization Pattern**:
   - Removed incorrect `asyncio.run()` wrapper that caused the error
   - Implemented module-level initialization like the eBay server
   - Server now initializes at import time and waits for MCP client connections

#### Technical Changes:
- **Removed**: Standalone runner approach with `asyncio.run()`
- **Added**: Module-level initialization using `asyncio.new_event_loop()`
- **Fixed**: Server now calls `mcp.run()` directly like `main_server.py`
- **Verified**: Both servers work identically with MCP Test UI

#### Multiple Server Support Confirmed:
✅ **eBay MCP Server** (`src/main_server.py`) - For eBay API tools
✅ **App MCP Server** (`src/app_server.py`) - For FastAPI app tools

Both servers can coexist in the project. Switch between them by:
- Changing `MCP_SERVER_PATH` in `.env` file
- Using the server path selector in MCP Test UI

#### Usage:
```bash
# Test eBay tools
MCP_SERVER_PATH=src/main_server.py ./start_mcp_test_ui.sh

# Test App tools
MCP_SERVER_PATH=src/app_server.py ./start_mcp_test_ui.sh
```

The App MCP Server now works exactly like the eBay MCP Server - no special handling required.

## Updates in App MCP Server Implementation (06062025 - 07:30:00)

### 🚀 NEW FEATURE: Independent App MCP Server for FastAPI Integration

**Created a new standalone MCP server that leverages FastMCP's built-in FastAPI integration to expose endpoints from https://api.petetreadaway.com as MCP tools.**

#### Key Features Implemented:

1. **FastMCP Native Integration**:
   - Uses `FastMCP.from_openapi()` to automatically generate MCP tools from OpenAPI specification
   - Connects to https://api.petetreadaway.com and fetches `/openapi.json` dynamically
   - Leverages FastMCP's automatic tool generation from FastAPI routes
   - No custom OpenAPI parsing required - uses FastMCP's built-in capabilities

2. **Configurable Endpoint Exclusions**:
   - Implemented configurable exclusion mechanism using custom route maps
   - Initially excludes sensitive/test endpoints:
     - `/api/product-images/reorder` (POST)
     - `/api/test-image-upload` (POST)
   - Uses `RouteType.IGNORE` to exclude specific endpoints from MCP tool generation
   - Easily configurable for future modifications via `EXCLUDED_ENDPOINTS` list

3. **Robust Architecture**:
   - Independent server at `src/app_server.py` (separate from eBay MCP server)
   - Follows existing project patterns for authentication, error handling, and logging
   - Uses environment variables for configuration (`APP_API_BASE_URL`, `APP_API_TIMEOUT`)
   - Proper resource cleanup with async context management

4. **Tool Generation Results**:
   - **19 total routes** processed from OpenAPI specification
   - **13 tools created** (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations)
   - **3 resources created** (GET operations without path parameters)
   - **2 endpoints excluded** as configured (reorder and test-image-upload)

5. **Authentication & Error Handling**:
   - HTTP client configured with proper headers and timeout handling
   - Follows existing logging patterns using the project's logging infrastructure
   - Comprehensive error handling for API connection and OpenAPI spec loading
   - Graceful resource cleanup on server shutdown

6. **Testing & Validation**:
   - Compatible with existing `start_mcp_test_ui.sh` testing infrastructure
   - Server can run independently without conflicts with eBay server
   - Verified tool discovery and resource enumeration functionality
   - Confirmed exclusion patterns work correctly

#### Technical Implementation:

**Files Created:**
- `src/app_server.py` - Main App MCP server implementation

**Key Components:**
- `AppMCPServer` class for server lifecycle management
- `_create_route_maps()` method for endpoint exclusion configuration
- Environment-based configuration with sensible defaults
- Async initialization and cleanup patterns

**Route Mapping Strategy:**
- Excludes specific endpoints using exact pattern matching
- Converts HTML-returning endpoints to tools (not resources)
- Uses FastMCP's default mapping for all other endpoints
- Processes route maps in order with exclusions taking precedence

#### Integration Benefits:

1. **Reusable Template**: Serves as a template for exposing other FastAPI applications as MCP servers
2. **Zero Code Duplication**: Automatically inherits all API endpoint definitions and validation
3. **Schema Preservation**: Maintains Pydantic models and validation from the original FastAPI app
4. **Future-Proof**: Automatically picks up new endpoints as they're added to the API
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Follows established project architecture and conventions

#### Usage:

```bash
# Run standalone
python src/app_server.py

# Test with MCP Test UI
# Server will be available for testing alongside existing eBay tools
```

This implementation demonstrates FastMCP's powerful OpenAPI integration capabilities and provides a foundation for exposing any FastAPI application as MCP tools with minimal configuration.

## Updates in Comprehensive Update Offer Tool Enhancement (05062025 - 06:40:00)

2. **Enhanced Documentation**:
   - Comprehensive field descriptions with business logic constraints
   - Clear indication of required vs optional vs conditional fields
   - Examples and format specifications for complex fields
   - Prominent warnings about REPLACE operation behavior

3. **Robust Validation**:
   - Pydantic field validators for all constraints (SKU length ≤ 50, quantities ≥ 0, etc.)
   - Proper type checking and format validation
   - Array size limits (store categories ≤ 2, etc.)

4. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Legacy `price` parameter automatically converted to `pricing_summary` format
   - Existing tool calls continue to work without modification

5. **Smart Data Preservation**:
   - Tool retrieves current offer data first

This update transforms the Update Offer tool from a basic price/quantity updater into a comprehensive offer management solution supporting all eBay Inventory API capabilities while maintaining safety through prominent warnings and data preservation features.

## Updates in Content-Language Header Fix for Update Offer Tool (05062025 - 07:05:00)

### 🔧 CRITICAL BUG FIX: Resolved eBay API Header Issues

**Fixed two critical header-related errors in the Update Offer tool:**

#### Issues Resolved:
1. **"Invalid value for header Content-Language" Error (Line 353 in logs)**
   - eBay API was rejecting Content-Language header in PUT requests
   - Error occurred during updateOffer API calls causing tool failures

2. **"Header value must be str or bytes, not <class 'NoneType'>" Error (Line 404 in logs)**
   - marketplace_id parameter could be None, causing invalid header values
   - Resulted in httpx client errors before API calls could be made

#### Root Cause Analysis:
- **Content-Language vs Accept-Language**: PUT operations to eBay API have different header requirements than GET operations
- **GET operations** (like get_offer_by_sku) work fine with `Accept-Language: en-GB`
- **PUT operations** (like updateOffer) were failing with Content-Language header validation
- **eBay API returns** `Content-Language: en_GB` (underscore format) in successful responses

#### Solutions Implemented:
1. **✅ COMPLETELY REMOVED Content-Language header** from updateOffer PUT requests
   - GET operations continue to use `Accept-Language: en-GB` successfully
   - PUT operations now work without any language headers (eBay defaults appropriately)
   - Tested multiple formats (`en-GB`, `en_GB`, `en-US`) - all were rejected by eBay API

2. **✅ FIXED marketplace_id None value handling**
   - `marketplace_id = params.marketplace_id or "EBAY_GB"` ensures no None values
   - Prevents "Header value must be str or bytes, not <class 'NoneType'>" errors

3. **✅ FIXED httpx automatic header injection**
   - Changed from `json=update_data` to `data=json.dumps(update_data)` in PUT request
   - Prevents httpx from automatically adding Content-Language headers based on system locale
   - Maintains explicit control over all request headers

4. **✅ CLEANED UP code hygiene**
   - Removed unused imports in update_offer.py
   - Added comprehensive inline documentation explaining the header strategy

#### Files Modified:
- `src/ebay_mcp/inventory/update_offer.py`: Fixed header construction and None handling
- `tests/test_update_offer_header_fix.py`: Added comprehensive header fix verification tests

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ No more "Invalid value for header Content-Language" errors
- ✅ No more "Header value must be str or bytes, not <class 'NoneType'>" errors
- ✅ Update Offer tool now works correctly with eBay API
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite confirms fixes are effective

This fix resolves the blocking issues that prevented the Update Offer tool from successfully communicating with eBay's API, enabling full functionality of the comprehensive offer management features.
